        <p class="content">You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it, I truly believe you will never go
            back to the
            traditionally 'boiled' beef. This recipe was given to my mother-in-law and it has become a treasured family
            recipe. The brisket is seared in a hot skillet to give it a caramelized surface when it's done, topped with
            sliced onions, garlic, and a drizzle of broth, then braised for about 6 hours for a tender, juicy roast.
            It's so worth the wait! I serve it with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips. It
            is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year round.</p>
