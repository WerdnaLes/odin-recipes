            <h2>What Is Irish Soda Bread?</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="content">Irish soda bread is a type of quick bread that relies on baking soda, not yeast, to rise. The
            bread contains
            buttermilk, which contains lactic acid. The acid reacts with the baking soda to create air bubbles,
            resulting in a perfectly risen dough.</p>
        <p class="content">Soda bread became incredibly common during the Irish Potato Famine, as you can make it with
            only four
            ingredients: flour, salt, an acid, and baking soda.</p>

            <h2>Irish Soda Bread Ingredients</h2>
        </header>
        <ul class="content">
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: This classic Irish soda bread starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Margarine</strong>: Margarine has a higher water content than butter, so the results are often
                softer. If you want, you can substitute Irish butter.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Four tablespoons of sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners</strong>: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the
                bread rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the Irish soda bread.</li>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong>: A cup of buttermilk adds flavor and helps the loaf rise even higher.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg lends richness and flavor. Plus, it helps bind the dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Brush the unbaked loaf with a mixture of buttermilk and butter before you bake
                it for extra flavor and shine.</li>
        </ul>
